## General info
It is one of the Data Analysing projects which is suppoused to hone my skills in that category.

Main goals of the project were:
* Explore Pandas DataFrame.
* Detect NaN values and clean given data.
* Select Particular columns, rows and idividual cells.
* Sort data.
* Group data by category.

As a notebook I used Datalore from Jetbrains.

It's one of the projects from [Angela's Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)
